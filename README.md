Phantom

Phantom is a high performance proxy for accessing distributed services. It is an RPC system with support for different
transports and protocols. Phantom is inspired by Twitter Finagle clients and builds on the capabilities of technologies like
Netty, Unix Domain Sockets, Netflix Hystrix and Spring. Phantom proxies have been used to serve hundreds of millions
of API calls in production deployments at Flipkart.
